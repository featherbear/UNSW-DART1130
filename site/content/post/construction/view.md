First I searched for a vector image of a mountain

![](/uploads/mountain-lake-sunset-landscape-first-person-view.jpg)  
([Mountain Vectors](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/246312-mountain-lake-sunset-landscape-first-person-view) by Vecteezy)

I then opened the image in Illustrator and changed all the colours to greyscale (removing the gradients). I then cleaned up the image, removing some extra trees, deleting some anchor points, and reordering some components.

After, I split the image into different layers, based on their lightness

I then printed out each layer and cut out the masked sections.

Each layer could then be placed over the RC paper one at a time, and exposed.

Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm

At first, I exposed every layer for only 1 second - which resulted in the final image turning out a bit pale, so I redid the image, being more generous with the exposure times

Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm  
With this image, I exposed different layers for different durations.  
This created more contrast between the landscape.

Physical offsets between each layer caused outlines (which appear as shadows) to be created, adding further depth into the image
