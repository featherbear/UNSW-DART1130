* Flip the film so that the shiny side is up
* Then rotate the film 180 degrees (such that the text is upside down)
* Then place it in the film holder

**Note: Hold by the film borders!**

* Focus the image - using a focus scope would be useful!

**Contrast Filters**

Contrast filters help to modify the tonal contrasts inside the film.  
Start with contrast **2.5** then adjust accordingly
