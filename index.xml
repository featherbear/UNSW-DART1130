He uses variadic light sources (changing their position) as well as the effects of casted shadows to further create depth and a sense of 3D-ness
Walead Beshty Walead used the physical attributes of his photograms as core components of the artwork itself. For example, he uses the creases of the paper in the photogram to create depth, and he focuses on the relationship between the material and the image.</description></item><item><title>View</title><link>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/construction/view/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 12:10:26 +0000</pubDate><author>z5206677@student.unsw.edu.au (Andrew Wong (z5206677))</author><guid>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/construction/view/</guid><description>First I searched for a vector image of a mountain
(Mountain Vectors by Vecteezy)
I then opened the image in Illustrator and changed all the colours to greyscale (removing the gradients). I then cleaned up the image, removing some extra trees, deleting some anchor points, and reordering some components.
After, I split the image into different layers, based on their lightness
I then printed out each layer and cut out the masked sections.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio</title><link>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/portfolio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 11:34:29 +0000</pubDate><author>z5206677@student.unsw.edu.au (Andrew Wong (z5206677))</author><guid>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/portfolio/</guid><description>Tone Cards Enlarger: 1s increments, f/11 @ 55cm

Bitumen that was exposed to the sunlight (8 hours) hardened, whilst the unexposed bitumen remained soft

Photograms are created by the placement of objects on light-sensitive paper or film.
Once exposed to light, the shape of the object is revealed.</description></item><item><title>Assessment 1 - See What Will Happen</title><link>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/assessment-1-see-what-will-happen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>z5206677@student.unsw.edu.au (Andrew Wong (z5206677))</author><guid>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/assessment-1-see-what-will-happen/</guid><description>Statement Sequence
a sequence of steps? a sequence in time?
From how we attempt to understand the world, to how nature controls itself.
There is order and method in everything that happens, is seen and is done.
I have chosen &amp;lsquo;sequence&amp;rsquo; as the central idea between my pieces of choice.
The first piece looks at the sequence of weather - of light, of dark, of rain, of peace. The second piece delves into the sequence of process, through artwork’s formation - multiple exposures of 8 different layer masks The third piece resonates with the sequence of routine – a depleted phone in need of charging The final piece freezes the sequence of time - a stop motion depiction of an object bouncing I have taken inspiration from Man Ray, who incorporates the use of multiple exposures in their artworks.</description></item><item><title>Ideas</title><link>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/ideas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 21:39:48 +1100</pubDate><author>z5206677@student.unsw.edu.au (Andrew Wong (z5206677))</author><guid>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/ideas/</guid><description>Shooting objects out of focus Under developed / Over developed Multiple exposures Light painting Moving an object during an exposure Have my hand in the exposure Object at different heights (this should affect diffusion + soft edges) Multiple light sources Newspaper Partial developer exposure Dodging and burning As a digital camera photographer, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to just apply those techniques onto these black and white prints - but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have more fun by taking a step back to try more simple, but experimental methods to create prints</description></item><item><title>Darkroom</title><link>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/darkroom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 21:33:33 +1100</pubDate><author>z5206677@student.unsw.edu.au (Andrew Wong (z5206677))</author><guid>https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-DART1130/post/darkroom/</guid><description>Enlarger A device to project a small negative onto a larger surface area.

Developing Place into the developing bath for 2 minutes Place into the water bath for 1 minute Place into the fixer bath for 5 minutes Place into the wash bath for 10 minutes Then either air dry or use the rolling dryer</description></item></channel></rss>
