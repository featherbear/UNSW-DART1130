# Ideas

* How a camera mediates, but also displaces the world
* Analogue techniques
* Contact printing
* Bathing the paper in solutions taken from the site
* Film camera superimposed on a camera
* Level - getting lower to the ground
  * Things that are not level
* Photo of something that is no longer - photo in a photo
* Light
* Deconstructed
* Shadows splitting things
  * Carpark
* Light shining towards camera

# Printing

![](/uploads/f8-10s-15s-29cm-1.jpg)![](/uploads/f8-10s-15s-29cm-2.jpg)  
f/8 10",15" @ 29cm - the background makes the exposure a bit hard to use. Even after different contrast filters, the background stands out too much.

## Vision

![](/uploads/vision/f11-5s-11cm-c2-5-ii.jpg)

![](/uploads/vision/f11-5s-11cm-c1-5.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 5" @ 11cm, Contrast 1.5  
Too light

![](/uploads/vision/f11-5s-11cm-c2-5.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 5" @ 11cm, Contrast 2.5  
Better

![](/uploads/vision/f8-5s-11cm-c2-5.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/8 5" @ 11cm, Contrast 2.5  
Too dark

![](/uploads/vision/f11-3s-5s-11cm-c2-5.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 3" & 5" @ 11cm, Contrast 2.5  
Left too light, right too dark

![](/uploads/vision/f11-4s-3s-11cm-c2-5.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 4" & 3" @ 11cm, Contrast 2.5  
Left side good, right side too light? Maybe use 4"

This one turned out pretty well, par the light leak in the middle of the photo - the two halves are moreorless aligned

![](/uploads/f5-6-12s-42cm.jpg)  
f/5.6 12s 42cm  
The heads are abit misaligned, but the centre division is better. Could be better

![](/uploads/f5-6-12s-42cm-c1-5.jpg)  
f/5.6 12s 42cm C1.5  
Tried flipping the film so that the left side image could have more detail. Face ended up squashed horizontally. Centre division is much better though

## Reality

Digital test shot

![](/uploads/f11-2s-7cm.jpg)  
f/11 2" 7cm - Too light

![](/uploads/f11-5s-7cm.jpg)  
f/11 5" 7cm - Better tones than the previous

![](/uploads/f8-5s-23cm.jpg)  
f/8 5" 23cm - Enlarged the print area to prepare for the final print

## Trapped

![](/uploads/f11-5s-23cm-c00.jpg)

f/11 5" 23cm C00 - too light

![](/uploads/f8-5s-23cm-c1.jpg)  
f/8 5" 23cm C1 - getting better

![](/uploads/f5-6-23cm-5s-c2-5.jpg)  
f/5.6 5" 23cm C2.5 - better detail, I like the shadows

![](/uploads/f5-6-5s-23cm-c2-5.jpg)  
f/2.8 5" 23cm C2.5 - too dark

![](/uploads/f5-6-fx1s-c2-5.jpg)  
f/5.6" 3x1" C2.5  
Multiple exposure test. Hard to see the subject from the multiple exposures.

## Concealed

![](/uploads/f4-5s-7s.jpg)  
Test shot: f/4 at 5s and 7s @ 42cm

![](/uploads/f4-5s-42cm.jpg)

Final: f/4 5s @ 42cm

## Trapped

![](/uploads/f4-1s-fog-5s-42cm-c3.jpg)  
f/4 1s fog, 5s exposure @ 42cm c3  
Abit too flat, would like some more contrast

![](/uploads/f4-8s-c3.jpg)  
f/4 3s fog, 8s @ 42cm C3

Added more contrast by fogging the for later, and exposing the film for longer.  
Also moved the page around a bit during the exposure to create some heavier shadows.  
Re-exposed the paper after development to add texture to the border
