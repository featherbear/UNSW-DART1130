# Tone Cards

![](/uploads/tone-cards/tone-card-1s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 1s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got 9 shades of grey. Probably 10s for max exposure

![](/uploads/tone-cards/tone-card-0-5s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 0.5s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got 13 shades of grey

![](/uploads/tone-cards/tone-card-test-1s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 1s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got only 7 shades of grey, with the entire image dipping to black too quickly

# Stationery (eh)

![](/uploads/material-test-1s-f8-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/8 @ 55cm - multiple 1s exposures  
Left: The plastic from the disposable lab coat  
Right: Pens and scissors

An opaque card was used to mask out the bottom left and top sections. After another 1s exposure, the dark section was formed

# Mountains

![](/uploads/mountain-test-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm  
A test strip where multiple masked exposures were made on.  
Out of accident the image positive and negative were physically moved, which caused the white sections of the mountain to form - However this yielded interesting results which created a heightened sense of 3D depth, apart from just tonal/shadow depth.

Likened to _Man Ray_'s use of multiple exposures within a single image

# Cycle

![](/uploads/cycle/cycle-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm  
Day: 0.5s peak,1s BG, 3s left, 6s right  
Night: 1s moon, 5s BG, 2s left, 3s right  
Storm: 0s lightning, 5s BG, 2s left, 3s right  
Peace: 1.5s left, 2s right  
[\[Preparation\]](/uploads/cycle/cycle-prep.jpg)

A sequence of mountains superimposing different weather times and conditions.  
The day image has some leaked light from a card that was meant to block light (oops)

# View

| Part 1 | Part 2 |
| :---: | :---: |
|  |  |

Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm  
[More](../construction/view)

Multiple exposures from eight different mask/stencil layers.  
The first image uses 1s exposures with all layers.  
The second image uses a combination of 1s and 2s exposures with the layers

Slight physical position offsets between layers have created an unexpected but pleasant outline and 3D depth in the image. A path from the mountaintop was also invariably created accidentally. Can be likened to Walead Beshty's images whose methods of procedure can be drawn through image detail (i.e. outlines)

# Bounce

![](/uploads/bounce-4s-8s-f16-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 4s/8s, f/16 @ 55cm

A sequence of images on the same paper that portray a 'ball' bouncing.  
Probably should have added some 'tweening' between the 'frames' with an external light or something...

# Charge

![](/uploads/charged-10s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 10s, f/11 @ 55cm

Proof of concept idea, showing the sequence of a phone running out of power and 'fading' (through the use of another phone case), until it is connected to power (right)

# Developer Drip

![](/uploads/developer-drip-bw.jpg)![](/uploads/developer-drip-colour.jpg)

Splashed some of the developer solution onto the RC paper.  
In terms of usability, it may be hard to use because the entire page would have to be exposed. However perhaps I can use this technique on a face portrait?

# Night Photography

(But with a digital camera, because film is expensive!)

![](/uploads/night/0t4a0988_dxo.jpg)  
I realise, my film camera's timer is broken - so I wouldn't be able to put myself in the photo without having another person press it...

![](/uploads/night/0t4a0992.JPG)  
68mm, f/5, 4", ISO 500 - DSLR

![](/uploads/night/0t4a0993.JPG)  
35mm, f/4, 1", ISO 400 - DSLR  
This one is sorta like, reaching out to the light

## Long Exposures

![](/uploads/night/0t4a1009_dxo.jpg)![](/uploads/night/0t4a1011_dxo.jpg)  
73mm, f/14, 8", ISO 400 - DSLR  
Stood in the photo for a partial amount of time, so that my silhouette would blend in (but not mask) the background

For the second photo, I ran into the shot halfway during the exposure

![](/uploads/night/0t4a1029.JPG)  
73mm, f/8, 4", ISO 400

# Film Rolls

## Exposure 25 - Cat

![](/uploads/cat-f2-8-125-dev-f8-14s.jpg)  
SLR: f/2.8 1/125s ISO 400  
Enlarger: 14s, f/8

Campus cats!

## Double Exposure 3 & 4

![](/uploads/f11-3s-2s-11cm-c2-5.jpg)

Enlarger: f/11 3" & 2" @ 11cm, Contrast 2.5.

Tried to capture a still subject in front of a busy environment (people walking around).  
But because of COVID-19, the city is abit quiet... People aren't hustling and bustling around as frequently nor quickly as before.

Can expose for longer, to darken the background

## Exposure 6 - Self

![](/uploads/f4-9s-80cm-c1-5.jpg)  
f/4 9s @ 80cm, Contrast 1.5

## Exposure 8 - Concealed

![](/uploads/f4-5s-42cm.jpg)  
f/4 5" @ 42cm

"Look past me, but what do you really see?"

## Exposures 11 & 12 - Vision

![](/uploads/f5-6-12s-42cm-c1-5.jpg)

f/5.6 12" @ 42cm, Contrast 1.5

Am I still me?

## Exposure 13 - Reflection

## Multiple Exposures 4-7 - Trapped

![](/uploads/f5-6-3x1-25-26cm-c2-5.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/5.6 3x1.25" @ 26cm, Contrast 2.5

![](/uploads/f5-6-4x0-6s-26cm-c2-5.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/5.6 4x0.6" @ 26cm, Contrast 2.5

"Are these four walls bored of me?"

## Exposure 14 - Caged

![](/uploads/f4-8s-c3.jpg)

Enlarger: f/4 8s, Contrast 3

Exposed the borders after partial development to create a non-uniform texture that emulates the dirtyness of the gates

## Exposures 16 & 17 - Reality

![](/uploads/f5-6-5s-23cm-c3.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/5.6 5" @ 23cm, Contrast 3

"I'm the same me, even on the other side"

## Exposure 18

![](/uploads/f5-6-5s.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/5.6 5s

The paper was fogged at the top right, so I decided to add some extra detail around the rest of the frame border. I enlarged the film and defocused it then exposed it shortly
