# Tone Cards

![](/uploads/tone-card-1s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 1s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got 9 shades of grey. Probably 10s for max exposure

![](/uploads/tone-card-0-5s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 0.5s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got 13 shades of grey

![](/uploads/tone-card-test-1s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 1s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got only 7 shades of grey, with the entire image dipping to black too quickly

# 

![](/uploads/material-test-1s-f8-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/8 @ 55cm - multiple 1s exposures  
Left: The plastic from the disposable lab coat  
Right: Pens and scissors  
  
An opaque card was used to mask out the bottom left and top sections. After another 1s exposure, the dark section was formed

# Mountains

![](/uploads/mountain-test-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm  
A test strip where multiple masked exposures were made on.  
Out of accident the image positive and negative were physically moved, which caused the white sections of the mountain to form - However this yielded interesting results which created a heightened sense of 3D depth, apart from just tonal/shadow depth
