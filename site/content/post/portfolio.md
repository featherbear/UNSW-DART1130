# Tone Cards

![](/uploads/tone-card-1s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 1s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got 9 shades of grey. Probably 10s for max exposure

![](/uploads/tone-card-0-5s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 0.5s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got 13 shades of grey

![](/uploads/tone-card-test-1s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 1s increments, f/11 @ 55cm  
Got only 7 shades of grey, with the entire image dipping to black too quickly

# Stationery (eh)

![](/uploads/material-test-1s-f8-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/8 @ 55cm - multiple 1s exposures  
Left: The plastic from the disposable lab coat  
Right: Pens and scissors

An opaque card was used to mask out the bottom left and top sections. After another 1s exposure, the dark section was formed

# Mountains

![](/uploads/mountain-test-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm  
A test strip where multiple masked exposures were made on.  
Out of accident the image positive and negative were physically moved, which caused the white sections of the mountain to form - However this yielded interesting results which created a heightened sense of 3D depth, apart from just tonal/shadow depth.

Likened to _Man Ray_'s use of multiple exposures within a single image

# Cycle

![](/uploads/cycle-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: f/11 @ 55cm  
Day: 0.5s peak,1s BG, 3s left, 6s right  
Night: 1s moon, 5s BG, 2s left, 3s right  
Storm: 0s lightning, 5s BG, 2s left, 3s right  
Peace: 1.5s left, 2s right  
[\[Preparation\]](/uploads/cycle-prep.jpg)

A sequence of mountains superimposing different weather times and conditions.  
The day image has some leaked light from a card that was meant to block light (oops)

# View

[More](../construction/view)

Multiple exposures from eight different mask/stencil layers.  
The first image uses 1s exposures with all layers.  
The second image uses a combination of 1s and 2s exposures with the layers

Slight physical position offsets between layers have created an unexpected but pleasant outline and 3D depth in the image. A path from the mountaintop was also invariably created accidentally. Can be likened to Walead Beshty's images whose methods of procedure can be drawn through image detail (i.e. outlines)

# Bounce

![](/uploads/bounce-4s-8s-f16-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 4s/8s, f/16 @ 55cm

A sequence of images on the same paper that portray a 'ball' bouncing.  
Probably should have added some 'tweening' between the 'frames' with an external light or something...

# Charge

![](/uploads/charged-10s-f11-55cm.jpg)  
Enlarger: 10s, f/11 @ 55cm

Proof of concept idea, showing the sequence of a phone running out of power and 'fading' (through the use of another phone case), until it is connected to power (right)

Campus cats!
