* Shooting objects out of focus
* Under developed / Over developed
* Multiple exposures
* Light painting
* Moving an object during an exposure
* Have my hand in the exposure
* Object at different heights (this should affect diffusion + soft edges)
* Multiple light sources
* Newspaper
* Partial developer exposure
* Dodging and burning

> As a digital camera photographer, it's easy to just apply those techniques onto these black and white prints - but I thought I'd have more fun by taking a step back to try more simple, but experimental methods to create prints

<!--

* Flower petals
* Prism
* Leaf
* Something textured - expose texture first, expose texture last
  * placemats?
  * tissues
  * fabrics
* Effect of marking the paper
  * Pencil
  * Pen
  * Can I rub off?
* Effect of object height
* 2D, 2.5D, 3D
* Fire and hand sanitiser (on a glass plate)
* Camera filters

# Sequence

<!-- Oof it's the same mountain but with different ideas -->
<!-- And within each idea there's different methods -->

* Sequence of exposures to paint a single image (i.e. mountain)
  * Get image
  * Turn grey scale
  * Adjust colour
  * Split into layers
  * Stencils of the negatives
  * Apply per-layer exposures
* Sequence of exposures in one (Day, night, rain, lightning)
* Motion (i.e. something bouncing / spinning)

# Ambience

> We are shaped by what we see and encounter, not just by what happens to us

<!-- * Use of  -->

* How a camera mediates, but also displaces the world
* Analogue techniques
* Contact printing
* Bathing the paper in solutions taken from the site
* Film camera superimposed on a camera
* Level - getting lower to the ground
  * Things that are not level
* Photo of something that is no longer - photo in a photo
* Light
* Deconstructed
* Shadows splitting things
  * Carpark
* Light shining towards camera

Blur

System based -

\* Speed, aperture, bracketing, focus

  * At the front (face behind) (portrait)
  * Surrounded (facing in front) (landscape)
* Carpark, person alone

\- Fingerprint / signature / passport - denied
